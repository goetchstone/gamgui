# 2026-09-23 — The framework's hooks were talking to nobody

- **Symptom:** the session-orient digest, the improve-rules nudge and the pre-commit checklist never
  reached the model. The session transcript recorded every firing with `content: ""` — including a
  nudge (7 fix commits + 3 ledger entries) that fired and was silently dropped. Only the hard `fix:`
  block worked.
- **Cause:** all three hooks printed to **stderr** and exited 0. Claude Code feeds a hook's stderr
  to the model only on a blocking exit 2; for SessionStart it is stdout that becomes context, and a
  non-blocking PreToolUse hook needs JSON `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` on stdout.
- **Why not caught:** the hooks were tested by running them in a shell, where stderr is visible — the
  test checked that text was printed, not that it reached the model.
- **Fix:** the hooks now write to the model-visible channel (SessionStart → stdout; PreToolUse →
  JSON `additionalContext`), and the checklist is trimmed to the items relevant to the changed files.
  Verified in-session: the injected checklist arrived as hook context. The nudge now also skips
  RULE-FEEDBACK entries marked **Resolved**.
- **Prevention:** [FRAMEWORK.md](FRAMEWORK.md) §2 now states the channel rule. No automated tripwire
  (the hooks are local, gitignored wiring) — verify a new or changed hook by looking for its text in
  the model's context, not in a terminal.
