# 2026-09-18 — Bulk onboarding applied the role signature to existing accounts

- **Symptom:** a CSV bulk run with `create_account=no` rows re-applied the role's signature
  template to those existing users, overwriting customized signatures; a row with no name
  rendered a blank `{name}`.
- **Cause:** when `_provision_hire` was factored out for the bulk executor, `_apply_signature`
  was placed under `if email:` (any row) instead of inside the account-creation branch, where the
  single `/run` flow keeps it.
- **Why not caught:** the bulk tests only covered `create_account=True` rows for the signature
  path; no test asserted the negative case, and the single-flow test didn't exercise the shared
  helper.
- **Fix:** apply the signature only when `res["account_created"]`; test
  `test_provision_hire_skips_signature_for_existing_account`.
- **Prevention:** when factoring a shared helper out of an existing flow, add a test for each
  branch the original gated (here: the create-only gate), not just the happy path.
