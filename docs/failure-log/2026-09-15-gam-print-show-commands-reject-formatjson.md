# 2026-09-15 — GAM print/show commands reject `formatjson`

- **Symptom:** several `print`/`show` commands (e.g. `print messages`,
  `print delegates`, `show vacation`, `show signature`) failed against a live
  tenant with a usage error, though the mock accepted them.
- **Cause:** those subcommands don't support the `formatjson` output flag we
  append by default for machine-readable parsing.
- **Why not caught:** `tests/fixtures/mock_gam.sh` accepted `formatjson` on any
  command — the mock was more permissive than real GAM, which converts a live
  break into a green test.
- **Fix:** stopped sending `formatjson` on the commands that reject it; parse
  their text output instead.
- **Prevention:** check every new command's flags against the vendored grammar
  `gamgui/resources/gam7/GamCommands.txt` (the source of truth, not memory), and
  make the mock reject what real GAM rejects. Captured as the standing
  invariant "the mock lies" in CLAUDE.md and the memory `gamgui-gam-formatjson`.
