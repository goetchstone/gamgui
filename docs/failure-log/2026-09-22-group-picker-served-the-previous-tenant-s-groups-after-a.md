# 2026-09-22 — Group picker served the previous tenant's groups after a domain switch

- **Symptom:** after switching domains via /setup/verify, the onboarding group picker kept returning
  the old tenant's groups for up to the 5-minute cache TTL.
- **Cause:** `AppState.group_cache` / `user_cache` are not domain-tagged, and the verify handler
  swapped the connector without busting them (the calendar index self-checks its stored domain, so
  it was already safe).
- **Why not caught:** no test switched tenants and re-read a cache; the picker was new.
- **Fix:** call `st.invalidate_users()` + `st.invalidate_groups()` after a successful verify.
  Test `test_setup_verify_busts_group_cache`.
- **Prevention:** any cross-request cache that isn't tagged with the tenant it was filled for must be
  invalidated on a tenant switch — prefer tagging (as the calendar index does) for new caches.
