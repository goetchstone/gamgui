# 2026-09-22 — Single /run stranded a created account's one-time password on a later failure

- **Symptom:** if the task-list step (or the assignee check) failed AFTER create_user succeeded, the
  response was a bare error box with no credentials sheet, so the temp password — never audited,
  never emailed — was lost; a retry 409s.
- **Cause:** run() validated the assignee and created the task list AFTER the account write, and both
  late failures returned `_err(...)`, a template with no credentials slot. The bulk path
  (_provision_hire) already handled this; run() had diverged.
- **Why not caught:** the mock's catch-all makes `create tasklist` always succeed, so no test could
  express a post-create failure; the single-flow test never patched the runbook call.
- **Fix:** hoist all non-writing validation before any mutation; once an account/membership exists,
  render the credentials sheet plus a task-list-failed banner instead of bare-erroring.
  Test `test_run_keeps_credentials_when_tasklist_fails`.
- **Prevention:** an irreversible write (account creation) must never be followed by a code path that
  can `return _err` and discard the one-shot secret it produced.
